</span><b>Context: </b><span style="font-weight: normal">Liver
cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. An estimated
830,000 people around the world died from the disease in 2020. <br/>
Liver resection is considered as one of the most effective treatments. <br/>
In this respect, laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) comes up by reducing
substantially patient trauma compared to open liver resection. <br/> 
The patient recovers faster which in return reduces healthcare costs. <br/> 
However the use of LLR remains limited. This is because of three challenges. <br/>
First, controlling intraoperative bleeding using laparoscopic instruments requires advanced technical skills. <br/> 
Second, the surgeon cannot manually palpate the liver and thus cannot locate the tumours and their
resection margins easily. <br/> 
Consequently this raises a risk of inadequate resection on the patient’s liver such as the removal of
too much healthy tissue and the leaving of some cancerogenous tissue behind. <br/> 
Third, laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS), the only tool for intraoperative subsurface imaging 
which allows real-time tumour localisation, has a long learning curve. <br/> 
This is because its design consists of a small transducer with a small field of view attached
to the end of a long shaft with a pivoting mechanism.

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">
In order to ease LLR, augmented reality (AR) based methods relying on preoperative data were proposed [1,2].<br/> 
These AR-based methods predict the location of the tumours by overlaying the preoperative data onto the laparoscopy image. <br/> These methods require the whole liver to be visible as much as possible in the laparoscopy image to make a reliable prediction. <br/> However, the liver is usually very partially visible (i.e., about 30% or less). <br/>
Although these methods are useful to guide surgeons at the very beginning of surgery, they are neither real-time nor automatic.<br/> <br/>

</span><b>Research:</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
<br/>
We are looking for one highly motivated PhD student to study on multimodal liver tumour registrations and augmentations <br/> to be able to guide the surgeons during LLR. The PhD student will focus on two open problems. <br/><br/>
1/ Automatic and real-time deformable registration of a preoperative CT volume to <br/>
an intraoperative LUS image without any additional tracker sensor.<br/>
2/ Augmentation of the subsurface liver tumours and veins in the laparoscopy images <br/> 
(i.e., occluded object visualisation) on a flat screen with the relevant depth cues <br/>
such that their depth can be conveyed to the surgeon accurately.<br/>
<br/>
The successful outcome of the PhD will simplify mini-invasive liver surgery. <br/>
It will shorten hospital stays, improve surgical safety and accuracy, and contribute to <br/>
an overall better quality of patient life and reduction of healthcare costs.<br/>
